DapperMediatR.Demo

This project is a simple demonstration of how to integrate Dapper with MediatR in a .NET Web API.
It was built as a learning experiment to explore lightweight data access patterns and the mediator pattern in action.

âœ¨ Features

Dapper ORM for lightweight data access.

MediatR for implementing the CQRS pattern and decoupling business logic from controllers.

.NET Web API structure for a simple, extendable service.

Clean and minimal project setup focusing on business logic flow rather than full enterprise complexity.
